## Expected Results

### Agent Count Scaling

**Good (Linear Scaling)**:
```
  10 agents:  500 steps/s,  5.0 KB/agent
  25 agents:  480 steps/s,  5.2 KB/agent
  50 agents:  460 steps/s,  5.5 KB/agent
 100 agents:  420 steps/s,  6.0 KB/agent
 200 agents:  380 steps/s,  6.5 KB/agent

Scaling: Near-linear (good!)
4x agents → 1.3x time
```

**Poor (Quadratic Scaling)**:
```
  10 agents:  500 steps/s
  25 agents:  300 steps/s  ← Degrading
  50 agents:  150 steps/s  ← Getting worse
 100 agents:   50 steps/s  ← Too slow!
 200 agents:   15 steps/s  ← Unusable

Scaling: Quadratic (investigate!)
4x agents → 10x time
```

### Step Count Scaling

**Good (Consistent Performance)**:
```
   50 steps:  450 steps/s,  2.22 ms/step
  100 steps:  445 steps/s,  2.25 ms/step
  250 steps:  440 steps/s,  2.27 ms/step
  500 steps:  435 steps/s,  2.30 ms/step

Performance: Stable over time
```

**Poor (Degrading Performance)**:
```
   50 steps:  450 steps/s,  2.22 ms/step
  100 steps:  400 steps/s,  2.50 ms/step  ← Slower
  250 steps:  300 steps/s,  3.33 ms/step  ← Much slower
  500 steps:  200 steps/s,  5.00 ms/step  ← Getting worse!

Performance: Degrades over time (memory leak?)
```

### Environment Size Scaling

**Expected Impact**:
```
   50x50:  500 steps/s  (baseline)
 100x100:  480 steps/s  (4% slower, acceptable)
 200x200:  420 steps/s  (16% slower, still good)
 500x500:  300 steps/s  (40% slower, may need optimization)
```

### Memory Growth

**Healthy**:
```
Start: 125.0 MB
End:   135.0 MB
Growth: +10.0 MB (for 500 steps, 50 agents)
Rate: 20 KB/step

✓ Memory stable, no leaks
```

**Concerning**:
```
Start: 125.0 MB
End:   525.0 MB
Growth: +400.0 MB (for 500 steps, 50 agents)
Rate: 800 KB/step

✗ Possible memory leak! Investigate.
```

### CPU Utilization

**Single-threaded Baseline**:
```
Cores: 8
Avg usage: 12.5% (1 core fully utilized)
Max usage: 95.0% (on core 0)

Note: Python GIL limits multi-core usage
```

**Well-optimized**:
```
Cores: 8
Avg usage: 45.0% (some parallelization)
Max usage: 85.0%

Note: Good use of available cores
```

## Interpreting Results

### Scaling Classification

**Linear Scaling (Good)**:
- 2x agents → 2x time (±20%)
- Sustainable for production
- Can predict performance at scale

**Sub-quadratic (Acceptable)**:
- 2x agents → 3x time
- May need optimization for large scale
- Watch for specific bottlenecks

**Quadratic or Worse (Poor)**:
- 2x agents → 4x+ time
- Critical optimization needed
- Identify O(n²) algorithms

### Performance Metrics

**Steps per Second**:
- Target: >100 steps/s for production
- Acceptable: 50-100 steps/s
- Slow: <50 steps/s

**Memory per Agent**:
- Efficient: <10 KB/agent
- Acceptable: 10-50 KB/agent
- High: >50 KB/agent

**Memory Growth**:
- Stable: <50 KB/step
- Acceptable: 50-200 KB/step
- Leak: >200 KB/step (investigate!)

### Red Flags

⚠️ **Watch for**:
- Non-linear scaling with agents
- Performance degradation over time
- Excessive memory growth
- Memory leaks (unbounded growth)
- CPU bottlenecks (<50% utilization on single core)

## Cross-Reference with Previous Phases

### Phase 1 (Macro) → Phase 4 (System)

```
Phase 1: _get_observation takes 40% of time
Phase 4: Scales quadratically with agents
Conclusion: Observation generation is THE scalability bottleneck
```

### Phase 2 (Component) → Phase 4 (System)

```
Phase 2: Spatial index rebuild takes 5ms for 1000 entities
Phase 4: Performance degrades with 200+ agents
Conclusion: Spatial indexing contributes to scaling issues
```

### Phase 3 (Line) → Phase 4 (System)

```
Phase 3: Line 46 (bilinear loop) takes 65% of observation time
Phase 4: Linear scaling breaks down around 100 agents
Conclusion: Vectorizing Line 46 could fix scaling
```

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Questions to Answer

1. **What's the maximum agent count?**
   - Based on scaling curves
   - For acceptable performance (>50 steps/s)
   - With available hardware

2. **What's the memory limit?**
   - Peak memory at max agents
   - Growth rate over time
   - Safety margin for production

3. **What hardware is needed?**
   - CPU cores (if parallelizable)
   - RAM requirements
   - Disk I/O for logging

4. **Are there stability issues?**
   - Memory leaks
   - Performance degradation
   - Crashes at scale

### Recommendations Format

```markdown
## Production Configuration

**Maximum Scale:**
- Agents: 150 (performance target: 75 steps/s)
- Steps: Unlimited (stable memory)
- Environment: 250x250 (acceptable overhead)

**Hardware Requirements:**
- CPU: 4+ cores (single-threaded limited)
- RAM: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended
- Disk: 100MB/hour logging

**Optimizations Needed:**
1. Vectorize observation generation (HIGH)
2. Optimize spatial index (MEDIUM)
3. Async database logging (LOW)

**Estimated Improvements:**
- After optimizations: 250 agents @ 100+ steps/s
- Memory: 30% reduction
- Scaling: Linear up to 500 agents
```

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Review Scaling Curves

```bash
cat profiling_results/phase4/system_profile.log
```

Look for:
- Linear vs non-linear scaling
- Performance cliffs (sudden degradation)
- Consistency across tests

### 2. Identify Limits

For each dimension (agents, steps, env size):
- What's the maximum scale?
- Where does performance degrade?
- What's the bottleneck?

### 3. Calculate Targets

```python
# Example calculation
target_steps_per_second = 100
current_steps_per_second = 50

required_speedup = target_steps_per_second / current_steps_per_second
# = 2x speedup needed

# From Phase 1-3, identify optimizations worth 2x:
# - Vectorize observation: 1.8x
# - Optimize spatial index: 1.3x
# - Batch database: 1.1x
# Total potential: 1.8 × 1.3 × 1.1 = 2.6x ✓
```

### 4. Cross-Reference All Phases

Create a comprehensive table:

| Issue | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Priority |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Observation | 40% | Radius impact | Line 46 loop | Scaling bottleneck | HIGH |
| Spatial | 25% | KD-tree rebuild | Tree construction | Linear for <100 | MEDIUM |
| Database | 15% | Buffer size | SQL execution | Minimal impact | LOW |

### 5. Plan Optimization Roadmap

**Phase 1: Quick Wins** (Target: 1.5x speedup)
- Implement caching
- Remove unnecessary operations
- Use memmap for resources

**Phase 2: Major Optimizations** (Target: 2x speedup)
- Vectorize observation generation
- Optimize spatial index
- Batch operations

**Phase 3: Architecture** (Target: 3x+ speedup)
- Multi-process agents
- GPU acceleration
- Async I/O

## Running Phase 4

### Quick Test

```bash
cd /workspace

# Quick mode (5-10 minutes)
python3 benchmarks/run_phase4_profiling.py --quick
```

### Full Analysis

```bash
# Full mode (20-30 minutes)
python3 benchmarks/run_phase4_profiling.py
```

**Note**: Phase 4 takes longer because it runs multiple complete simulations at different scales.

## Success Criteria

Phase 4 is complete when you have:

- [x] Phase 4 infrastructure implemented
- [ ] Scaling tests executed
- [ ] Scaling curves analyzed
- [ ] Performance limits identified
- [ ] Production configuration defined
- [ ] Optimization roadmap created

## Integration with CI/CD

After establishing baselines, add to CI:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/performance.yml
- name: Performance Regression Test
  run: |
    python3 benchmarks/run_phase4_profiling.py --quick
    python3 benchmarks/check_performance_regression.py
```

This catches performance regressions before they reach production.

**Status**: Phase 4 infrastructure complete and ready to run!

**Next**: Execute Phase 4 profiling to establish performance baselines and production limits.
