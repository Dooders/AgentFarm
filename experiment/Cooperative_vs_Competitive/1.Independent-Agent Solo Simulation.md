# Experiment 1: Independent Agent Solo Simulation

### Objective: Understand the baseline behavior of IndividualAgents without any influence from SystemAgents.

### Setup:
* Initialize a simulation with only IndividualAgents.
* Set the total number of agents to a fixed number (e.g., 100 agents).
  
Data to Collect:
* Survival rates over time.
* Resource accumulation per agent.
* Frequency of competitive interactions (e.g., attacks).
  
Expected Observations:
* High competition for resources.
* Potential for over-exploitation of resources leading to rapid depletion.
* Survival dependent on aggressive strategies.
