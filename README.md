AgentFarm is a digital research platform experimenting with simulations of complex systems. It is designed as a workbench to explore and compare simulation outcomes and includes a fully integrated AI assistant. This assistant will manage complex tasks and analyses, such as interpreting simulation results, generating visualizations, and assisting in documentation.

Key features include:

1. Agent-Based Modeling: The platform focuses on creating and analyzing agent-based simulations, where agents can interact, adapt, and evolve.


2. Dynamic Analysis: Users can explore how agent interactions and environmental factors affect the system over time, revealing emergent behaviors.


3. Customizable Simulations: AgentFarm allows users to define parameters, rules, and environments, supporting a wide variety of experiments.


4. AI Integration: The AI assistant helps with:

Interpreting simulation data.

Creating visual and textual summaries.

Automating routine tasks, such as parameter sweeps or optimization.



5. Data-Driven Design: Built on a comprehensive data schema to store and track:

Agent behaviors and interactions.

Resource states and availability.

Simulation metrics and trends over time.

Agent learning experiences and decision-making.



6. User-Centric Features:

A results dashboard for visualization and analysis.

Support for comparative studies of simulation outcomes.

Tools to document findings and generate reports.




AgentFarm will be a hub for research, experimentation, and exploration, empowering users to model and understand the dynamics of complex systems in a controlled, flexible, and insightful way.
