## Logging & Observability ‚ú®

AgentFarm now includes **professional-grade structured logging** with `structlog`:

**Key Features:**
- üîç Rich contextual logs (simulation_id, step, agent_id, etc.)
- üìä Machine-readable JSON output for analysis
- üé® Multiple formats: Console (colored), JSON, plain text
- ‚ö° Performance-optimized with log sampling
- üõ°Ô∏è Automatic sensitive data censoring

**Quick Example:**
```python
from farm.utils import configure_logging, get_logger

configure_logging(environment="development", log_level="INFO")
logger = get_logger(__name__)

logger.info("simulation_started", num_agents=100, num_steps=1000)
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher (3.9+ recommended for best performance)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- Redis (optional, for enhanced memory management)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dooders/AgentFarm.git
cd AgentFarm

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install Redis for enhanced memory management
# Note: Redis is used for agent memory storage and can improve performance
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install redis-server
# On macOS: brew install redis
# On Windows: Download from https://redis.io/download
# Then start Redis: redis-server
```

### Running Your First Simulation

AgentFarm provides multiple ways to run simulations:

**Command Line (Simple)**
```bash
python run_simulation.py --environment development --steps 1000
```

**Experiments and Tools**
```bash
# Run experiments with parameter variations
python farm/core/cli.py --mode experiment --environment development --experiment-name test --iterations 3

# Visualize existing simulation results
python farm/core/cli.py --mode visualize --db-path simulations/simulation.db

# Generate analysis reports
python farm/core/cli.py --mode analyze --db-path simulations/simulation.db
```

**Results**
All simulation results are saved in the `simulations` directory with database files, logs, and analysis reports.

### API Server

Run the REST/WebSocket API for managing simulations and analysis:

```bash
# From repository root
python -m farm.api.server
# or
python farm/api/server.py
```

Defaults:
- Binds to port 5000
- Writes logs to `logs/api.log`

Key endpoints:
- `POST /api/simulation/new` ‚Äî create and run a simulation
- `GET /api/simulation/<sim_id>/step/<step>` ‚Äî fetch a specific step
- `GET /api/simulation/<sim_id>/analysis` ‚Äî run analysis
- `GET /api/simulation/<sim_id>/export` ‚Äî export data

### Benchmarks

```bash
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmarks
# or a specific benchmark
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmarks --benchmark memory_db
```
See `benchmarks/README.md` for details and recommended configurations.

### Testing

```bash
# Using pytest
pytest -q

# Or using the bundled test runner
python run_tests.py
```

## Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class or module should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility to reduce complexity.
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Entities should be open for extension (e.g., via new subclasses) but closed for modification, allowing behavior addition without altering existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses must be substitutable for their base classes without breaking program behavior, honoring the base class's contract.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use; prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces), not concrete implementations, to decouple components.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid duplicating code or logic; centralize shared functionality to improve maintainability and reduce errors.
- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: Favor simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones to enhance readability and reduce bugs.
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer composing objects (e.g., via dependencies) to achieve behavior rather than relying on inheritance hierarchies, for greater flexibility.
