```

### Running Your First Simulation

AgentFarm provides multiple ways to run simulations:

**Command Line (Simple)**
```bash
python run_simulation.py --config config.yaml --steps 1000
```

**Command Line Interface (Advanced)**
```bash
# Run simulation with various options
python farm/core/cli.py --mode simulate --config config.yaml --steps 1000

# Run experiments with parameter variations
python farm/core/cli.py --mode experiment --config config.yaml --experiment-name test --iterations 3

# Visualize existing simulation results
python farm/core/cli.py --mode visualize --db-path simulations/simulation.db

# Generate analysis reports
python farm/core/cli.py --mode analyze --db-path simulations/simulation.db
```

**GUI Interface**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Results**
All simulation results are saved in the `simulations` directory with database files, logs, and analysis reports.

### Live Simulation Config Explorer

The project includes a modern React-based configuration explorer built with Electron for cross-platform desktop deployment:

**Hierarchical Configuration Interface:**
- **Environment**: World settings, population parameters, resource management
- **Agent Behavior**: Movement, gathering, combat, and sharing parameters
- **Learning & AI**: General and module-specific learning configurations
- **Visualization**: Display settings, animation controls, and metrics display

The interface features a complete hierarchical folder structure with collapsible sections for intuitive parameter organization and real-time configuration editing with live validation.

**Greyscale Theme**

- Professional greyscale palette via CSS variables in `src/styles/index.css`
- Leva greyscale overrides in `src/styles/leva-theme.css` with `data-theme="custom"`
- Typography: Albertus for labels (12px), JetBrains Mono for numbers (11-12px)
- Compact controls: exactly 28px height; subtle borders; monochrome focus rings
- Optional full-UI grayscale filter: `localStorage.setItem('ui:grayscale','true')`

**ðŸ“‹ Issue #9: Complete Leva Folder Structure - COMPLETED**
- âœ… All configuration sections organized in logical Leva folders
- âœ… Folder hierarchy matches design specification
- âœ… Folders can be collapsed/expanded
- âœ… Configuration values properly bound to folders
- âœ… No missing parameters or orphaned controls
- âœ… Comprehensive path mapping system implemented
- âœ… Complete test coverage for all functionality
- âœ… Updated documentation and Storybook stories

- **Complete hierarchical folder structure** with 4 main sections and 12 sub-folders
- **Validation Display System (Issue #12)**: Inline errors/warnings with section scoping and a summary panel
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development
- Cross-platform packaging (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Zustand state management with persistence
- Advanced Leva controls integration with path mapping system
- Comprehensive testing with Vitest and Jest
- TypeScript path mapping with `@/` aliases

### Validation UI and Integration

- Components:
  - `src/components/Validation/ValidationDisplay.tsx`: Show errors/warnings for exact paths or prefixed sections.
  - `src/components/Validation/ValidationSummary.tsx`: Form-level overview with counts and top issues.

- Where used:
  - `src/components/ConfigExplorer/RightPanel.tsx`: Renders `ValidationSummary` in the Validation Status section.
  - `src/components/ConfigExplorer/LeftPanel.tsx`: Renders section-scoped `ValidationDisplay` blocks.
  - `src/components/LevaControls/LevaControls.tsx`: Debounced field validation on change updates the validation store.

- Validation service:
  - `src/services/validationService.ts` integrates Zod results and classifies extra rules: capacity=error; performance/memory=warnings.

- Tests:
  - `src/components/__tests__/ValidationDisplay.test.tsx`
  - `src/components/__tests__/ValidationSummary.test.tsx`

## Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class or module should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility to reduce complexity.
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Entities should be open for extension (e.g., via new subclasses) but closed for modification, allowing behavior addition without altering existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses must be substitutable for their base classes without breaking program behavior, honoring the base class's contract.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use; prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces), not concrete implementations, to decouple components.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid duplicating code or logic; centralize shared functionality to improve maintainability and reduce errors.
- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: Favor simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones to enhance readability and reduce bugs.
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer composing objects (e.g., via dependencies) to achieve behavior rather than relying on inheritance hierarchies, for greater flexibility.
