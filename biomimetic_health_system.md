# Biomimetic Health System Integration Documentation

## Overview
The integration of the biomimetic health system into the `BaseAgent` class represents a significant enhancement to the simulation's biological realism and complexity. This document details the key changes and their benefits.

## Core Changes

### 1. Health System Initialization
```python
def __init__(self, ..., use_biomimetic_health: bool = None):
    # Determine whether to use biomimetic health system
    if use_biomimetic_health is None:
        use_biomimetic_health = getattr(self.config, 'enable_temperature', False)
    
    if use_biomimetic_health:
        self.health_system = BiomimeticHealthSystem(starting_health=self.starting_health)
        self.current_health = self.health_system.health_vector.get_overall_health()
    else:
        self.health_system = None
        self.current_health = self.starting_health
```

**Benefits:**
- Backward compatibility with legacy health system
- Seamless integration with environment temperature settings
- Flexible initialization based on configuration
- Clean separation of concerns between health systems

### 2. Environmental Integration in Action Cycle
```python
def act(self):
    # Update biomimetic health system if enabled
    if self.health_system:
        env_temp = self.environment.get_temperature(self.position)
        health_metrics = self.health_system.update(env_temp, is_resting=False)
        self.current_health = self.health_system.health_vector.get_overall_health()
```

**Benefits:**
- Real-time health updates based on environmental conditions
- Dynamic response to temperature changes
- Integration with memory system for environmental learning
- Stress tracking through allostatic load

### 3. Enhanced Combat System
```python
def take_damage(self, damage: float) -> bool:
    if self.health_system:
        damage_applied = self.health_system.take_damage(damage)
        self.current_health = self.health_system.health_vector.get_overall_health()
        self.health_system.allostatic_system.add_stress("combat", damage / self.starting_health)
```

**Benefits:**
- More realistic damage modeling
- Integration of combat stress into overall health
- Allostatic load tracking for long-term effects
- Improved death determination logic

### 4. Dynamic Performance Modifiers
```python
@property
def attack_strength(self) -> float:
    if self.health_system:
        attack_modifier = self.health_system.behavior_modifiers.get("attack_strength", 1.0)
        return base_strength * attack_modifier
```

**Benefits:**
- Health-dependent performance scaling
- More realistic combat mechanics
- Dynamic behavior modification based on health state
- Improved strategic depth

### 5. Rest and Recovery System
```python
def rest(self) -> float:
    if self.health_system:
        env_temp = self.environment.get_temperature(self.position)
        health_metrics = self.health_system.update(env_temp, is_resting=True)
        old_health = self.current_health
        self.current_health = self.health_system.health_vector.get_overall_health()
        return self.current_health - old_health
```

**Benefits:**
- More realistic recovery mechanics
- Temperature-dependent healing
- Resource-efficient rest state
- Measurable recovery tracking

### 6. Memory Integration
```python
def remember_experience(self, action_name: str, reward: float, ...):
    if self.health_system and self.memory:
        metadata.update({
            "temperature": env_temp,
            "body_temperature": health_metrics.get("temperature", 37.0),
            "stress": health_metrics.get("temperature_stress", 0),
            "allostatic_load": health_metrics.get("allostatic_load", 0),
        })
```

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced learning from environmental experiences
- Better adaptation to temperature changes
- Improved decision-making through memory
- Rich metadata for analysis
