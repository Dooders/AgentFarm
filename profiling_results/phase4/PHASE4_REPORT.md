## System Profiling

## Scaling Analysis

### Agent Count Scaling

How does performance change as you add more agents?

- **Linear**: Time increases proportionally (good)
- **Sub-quadratic**: Time increases faster but manageable
- **Quadratic or worse**: Significant performance issues

### Step Count Scaling

How does performance change over longer simulations?

- Should be linear (constant time per step)
- Watch for memory leaks (increasing memory per step)
- Check for performance degradation over time

### Environment Size Scaling

How does performance change with world size?

- Spatial index performance
- Resource distribution overhead
- Agent movement patterns

## Resource Usage

### Memory

- **Initial**: Memory at simulation start
- **Peak**: Maximum memory during run
- **Growth rate**: Memory increase per step
- **Per agent**: Memory overhead per agent

### CPU

- **Utilization**: Percentage of CPU used
- **Cores**: Number of cores effectively used
- **Efficiency**: Single vs multi-core performance

## Production Readiness

Based on system profiling, assess:

1. **Scalability**: Can handle target workload?
2. **Stability**: Memory leaks or crashes?
3. **Performance**: Meets throughput requirements?
4. **Resource usage**: Acceptable CPU/memory?

## Recommendations

Based on scaling analysis:

- **Agent limit**: Maximum agents for target performance
- **Step limit**: Maximum steps before degradation
- **Environment size**: Optimal world dimensions
- **Hardware requirements**: CPU/RAM recommendations

## Next Steps

1. Review scaling curves and identify limits
2. Identify non-linear scaling components
3. Cross-reference with Phase 1-3 findings
4. Implement targeted optimizations
5. Re-run system profiling to validate
6. Establish performance benchmarks for CI/CD
