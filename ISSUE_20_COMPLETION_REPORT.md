# Issue #20 Completion Report: Status Bar with Validation Feedback

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Status Bar for the configuration GUI, providing real-time validation feedback, save state indicators, and system status information.

## Key Changes
- Added `src/components/Layout/StatusBar.tsx` and integrated it into `DualPanelLayout` (bottom of the app layout).
- Validation feedback:
  - Live error and warning counts from `useValidationStore`.
  - Manual "Validate" action triggers `validateConfig()`.
  - Auto-validate toggle (persisted in `localStorage` as `ui:auto-validate`) periodically refreshes validation.
  - "View Issues" button scrolls/focuses the validation section (`#validation-content`).
- Save status indicators:
  - Unsaved/Saved indicator using `isDirty`.
  - File path ellipsized with tooltip.
  - Last Save/Load times displayed when available.
- System status:
  - IPC connection status from `ipcService.getConnectionStatus()` (polled every second).

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Status bar provides comprehensive feedback
- ✅ Validation status updates in real-time
- ✅ Save status is clearly communicated
- ✅ System information is useful and accurate
- ✅ Status bar doesn't impact performance (lightweight polling, minimal re-rendering)
- ✅ All indicators are visually clear

## Tests
- Added/expanded `src/components/__tests__/StatusBar.test.tsx` to validate:
  - Rendering of validation controls and counts
  - Unsaved indicator when `isDirty` is true
  - Auto-validate toggle interaction
  - Navigation via "View Issues" scroll/focus
  - Dynamic updates when validation store changes

## Notes
- Auto-validation interval defaults to 3s; can be tuned if needed.
- Connection status uses the existing IPC service and matches the toolbar’s status approach.
