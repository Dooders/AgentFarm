# Race Condition Bug Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Identified

The original async refactoring introduced a **critical race condition** where:

1. Async endpoints used `asyncio.Lock()` to protect shared dictionaries
2. Background tasks (running in thread pools) used `threading.Lock()` for the same data
3. **These two lock types DO NOT coordinate with each other!**

### Why This Was Dangerous

```python
# Two different lock types for the same data = NO MUTUAL EXCLUSION!
_active_simulations_lock = asyncio.Lock()      # For async endpoints
_active_simulations_thread_lock = threading.Lock()  # For background tasks

# Both can access active_simulations simultaneously:
# ‚ùå Async endpoint holds asyncio.Lock
# ‚ùå Background thread holds threading.Lock  
# ‚ùå Both modify active_simulations at the same time
# üí• DATA CORRUPTION!
```

---

## Solution Implemented

### Unified Locking Strategy

**Use `threading.Lock` everywhere**, but access it safely in async code:

```python
# Single source of truth - threading.Lock for all contexts
_active_simulations_lock = threading.Lock()
_active_analyses_lock = threading.Lock()
_analysis_semaphore = threading.Semaphore(MAX_CONCURRENT_ANALYSES)
```

### AsyncThreadLock Helper

Created a helper class to acquire `threading.Lock` in async code without blocking the event loop:

```python
class AsyncThreadLock:
    """Context manager to acquire threading.Lock in async code non-blockingly."""
    
    def __init__(self, lock: threading.Lock):
        self.lock = lock
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        # Acquire in thread pool - no event loop blocking!
        await asyncio.to_thread(self.lock.acquire)
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.lock.release()  # Release is fast, no blocking
        return False
```

### Usage Pattern

**In Async Endpoints:**
```python
async def some_endpoint():
    async with AsyncThreadLock(_active_simulations_lock):
        # Safely access shared data
        data = active_simulations[sim_id]
```

**In Background Tasks (Threads):**
```python
def background_task():
    with _active_simulations_lock:
        # Directly use threading.Lock
        active_simulations[sim_id] = "running"
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dual Lock System ‚úÖ

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
_active_simulations_lock = asyncio.Lock()
_active_simulations_thread_lock = threading.Lock()
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
_active_simulations_lock = threading.Lock()  # Single lock for all contexts
```

### 2. Updated Background Task Functions ‚úÖ

Fixed all background task functions to use the unified locks:

- `_run_simulation_background()` 
- `_run_analysis_background()`
- `_cleanup_old_analyses()`

**Before:**
```python
with _active_simulations_thread_lock:  # ‚ùå Non-existent variable
    ...
```

**After:**
```python
with _active_simulations_lock:  # ‚úÖ Unified lock
    ...
```

### 3. Updated All Async Endpoints ‚úÖ

All 15+ async endpoints now use `AsyncThreadLock`:

```python
async with AsyncThreadLock(_active_simulations_lock):
    # Safe access to shared data
```

### 4. Fixed Double Lock Acquisition ‚úÖ

Added clear comments where lock is intentionally acquired twice in separate operations:

```python
# Get controller while holding lock
async with AsyncThreadLock(_active_analyses_lock):
    controller = active_analyses[id].get("controller")

controller.stop()  # Call without lock

# Update status while holding lock
async with AsyncThreadLock(_active_analyses_lock):
    active_analyses[id]["status"] = "stopped"
```

---

## Why This Solution Works

### ‚úÖ True Mutual Exclusion

`threading.Lock` provides **real mutual exclusion** across:
- Event loop (via `asyncio.to_thread()`)
- Thread pool (direct acquisition)

### ‚úÖ No Event Loop Blocking

Using `asyncio.to_thread()` ensures:
- Lock acquisition happens in thread pool
- Event loop stays responsive
- Other requests can be processed

### ‚úÖ Performance

- **Negligible overhead** from thread pool dispatch
- **Much better** than original blocking implementation
- **Critical safety** gain from preventing race conditions

---

## Verification

### Syntax Check ‚úÖ
```bash
python3 -m py_compile farm/api/server.py
# Exit code: 0 (success)
```

### Code Review ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ No mixed lock types
- ‚úÖ All background tasks use unified locks
- ‚úÖ All async endpoints use AsyncThreadLock
- ‚úÖ Double acquisitions are documented
- ‚úÖ Clear comments explain strategy

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
```python
def test_concurrent_access():
    """Test that async and thread access is truly synchronized."""
    # Simulate concurrent access from async endpoint and background task
    # Verify no data corruption
```

### Load Tests
```bash
# Run concurrent requests to verify no race conditions
ab -n 1000 -c 50 http://localhost:5000/api/simulations
```

### Monitor Logs
```python
# Watch for any "data inconsistency" errors
# Check simulation/analysis status transitions are atomic
```

---

## Documentation Updates

### 1. Added Comprehensive Comments

```python
# IMPORTANT: Thread-Safe Locking Strategy
# ==========================================
# The shared dictionaries (active_simulations, active_analyses) are accessed from:
# 1. Async endpoints (event loop context)
# 2. Background tasks (thread pool context via BackgroundTasks)
#
# We MUST use threading.Lock for these shared resources because:
# - asyncio.Lock only works within the event loop (not thread-safe)
# - threading.Lock provides mutual exclusion across both threads and event loop
# - In async code, we acquire threading locks via asyncio.to_thread() to avoid blocking
#
# This ensures true mutual exclusion and prevents race conditions.
```

### 2. Clear Helper Class Documentation

```python
class AsyncThreadLock:
    """Context manager to acquire threading.Lock in async code non-blockingly.
    
    This allows async code to safely access shared data that's also accessed
    from thread pool background tasks, without blocking the event loop.
    
    Usage:
        async with AsyncThreadLock(my_threading_lock):
            # Safe access to shared data
    """
```
