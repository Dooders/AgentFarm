# Learning Rate Sweep Configuration
# Run multiple experiments with different learning rates
#
# Usage:
#   python run_simulation.py --use-hydra --sweep learning_rate_sweep
#   Or with Hydra's native multi-run:
#   python run_simulation_hydra.py -m learning.learning_rate=0.0001,0.0005,0.001,0.005

defaults:
  - /config
  - override /hydra/sweeper: basic

# Hydra multi-run configuration

  sweeper:
    # Basic sweeper configuration
    params:
      learning.learning_rate: range(0.0001, 0.001, 0.0001)  # 0.0001, 0.0002, ..., 0.001
      simulation_steps: 100  # Keep steps constant for faster sweeps

# Override defaults for sweep
