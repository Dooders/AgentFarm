- ✅ get_nearest edge cases (nonexistent indices, empty structures)
- ✅ register_index errors (unknown types)
- ✅ Initialization with index_configs and index_data
- ✅ set_references warnings for string agent IDs
- ✅ Entity type determination (agents, resources, unknown)

## Coverage by Module

| Module | Statements | Missing | Coverage |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| `__init__.py` | 5 | 0 | **100%** ✅ |
| `dirty_regions.py` | 83 | 0 | **100%** ✅ |
| `hash_grid.py` | 111 | 1 | **99%** ✅ |
| `index.py` | 584 | 25 | **96%** ✅ |
| `quadtree.py` | 124 | 5 | **96%** ✅ |
| **TOTAL** | **907** | **31** | **97%** ✅ |

## Missing Coverage Lines

### hash_grid.py (1 line - 99% coverage)
- Line 73: Edge case in `remove()` when bucket exists but entity not found

### index.py (25 lines - 96% coverage)
- Lines 189-190: Warning log for string agent IDs (tested but not covered by coverage tool)
- Line 208: Specific index config continuation case
- Lines 456-463: Update entity position for spatial hash within same cell (rare edge case)
- Lines 562-566: Memory error handling in enable_batch_updates
- Line 819: Empty data reference case in _rebuild_named_index
- Line 962: Unknown index type in get_nearby (would raise ValueError earlier)
- Line 1018: Unknown index type in get_nearest (would raise ValueError earlier)
- Lines 1025, 1052, 1059-1062: Quadtree nearest neighbor implementation details
- Lines 1109, 1199: Edge cases in get_nearby_range for unknown index types

## Test Execution

All **302 tests pass** successfully with no failures.

```bash
cd /workspace && pytest tests/spatial/ -v --cov=farm/core/spatial
```

## Key Testing Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: From 79% to 97% overall coverage
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Extensive testing of boundary conditions, error handling, and unusual inputs
3. **Performance Testing**: Tests with 1000+ entities to verify scalability
4. **Integration Testing**: Tests combining multiple operations and index types
5. **Documentation**: Each test class and method has clear docstrings explaining what is being tested

## Recommendations

1. **Current Coverage is Excellent**: At 97%, the spatial module has very good test coverage
2. **Remaining Gaps**: The 31 missing lines are mostly:
   - Error handling paths that are difficult to trigger
   - Logging statements
   - Defensive code for edge cases that would fail earlier
   - Internal implementation details in quadtree nearest neighbor search

3. **No Critical Gaps**: All main functionality paths are well-tested

## Test Organization

Tests are organized into logical groups:
- **Initialization tests**: Verify proper setup and configuration
- **Operation tests**: Test core functionality (insert, remove, move, query)
- **Edge case tests**: Boundary conditions, invalid inputs, error handling
- **Integration tests**: Combined operations and real-world scenarios
- **Performance tests**: Scalability and efficiency checks

This structure makes it easy to understand what is tested and identify any gaps.
