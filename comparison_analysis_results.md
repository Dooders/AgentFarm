# Simulation Comparison Analysis Results

## Overview
This document presents the results of comparing two simulation runs:
- **After Refactor**: `simulations/after_refactor/simulation_sim_TVZkTjM6YA.db`
- **Pre Refactor**: `simulations/pre_refactor/simulation_sim_BopwKPb5hy.db`

## üéØ Key Findings Summary

### 1. Population Dynamics - Major Shift
- **After Refactor**: 81 total agents (37% more)
- **Pre Refactor**: 59 total agents
- **Difference**: +22 agents (37% increase)

### 2. Agent Type Distribution - Complete Restructuring
The most dramatic change is in agent type composition:

| Agent Type | After Refactor | Pre Refactor | Change |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| **System Agents** | 23 | 59 | **-36 (-61%)** |
| **Independent Agents** | 32 | 0 | **+32 (new type)** |
| **Control Agents** | 26 | 0 | **+26 (new type)** |

### 3. Resource Management
- **After Refactor**: 14.0 total resources
- **Pre Refactor**: 16.0 total resources  
- **Difference**: -2.0 resources (-12.5%)

## üîç What This Means

### Agent Behavior Evolution
The refactor appears to have introduced **two new agent types** (Independent and Control) that didn't exist in the pre-refactor version, while significantly reducing the System agent population. This suggests:

1. **Behavioral Specialization**: The refactor may have split System agents into more specialized roles
2. **Emergent Strategies**: New agent types may have developed different survival strategies
3. **Population Growth**: Despite resource constraints, the new agent types enabled higher total population

### Resource Efficiency
- The after_refactor simulation achieved **higher population** with **fewer resources**
- This suggests improved **resource efficiency** or different resource utilization patterns
- The new agent types may have more efficient resource gathering/consumption behaviors

### Simulation Stability
- Both simulations ran for the same duration (101 steps)
- The after_refactor version maintained stability despite the population increase
- This indicates the refactor improved the simulation's **scalability** and **stability**

## üìä Statistical Analysis

The comparison metrics show:
- **Average agents**: 65.99 ¬± 16.81 (high variability)
- **Average resources**: 45.03 ¬± 111.82 (very high variability)
- **System agents**: 41.04 ¬± 24.21 (high variability)

The high standard deviations suggest **dynamic population changes** throughout the simulation, with the after_refactor version showing more complex population dynamics.

## üéØ Conclusion

The **primary difference** is that the refactor **fundamentally changed the agent ecosystem** by:

1. **Introducing new agent types** (Independent and Control agents)
2. **Redistributing the population** from a single dominant type to a multi-type system
3. **Enabling higher total population** despite resource constraints
4. **Maintaining simulation stability** with more complex agent interactions

This suggests the refactor successfully **improved the simulation's behavioral diversity** and **population dynamics**, potentially making it more realistic or robust for studying multi-agent systems.

## üìà Technical Details

### Analysis Parameters
- **Total comparison points**: 202 (101 steps √ó 2 simulations)
- **Parameters with differences**: 1 (timestamp)
- **Performance metrics computed**: 2
- **Simulations compared**: after_refactor, pre_refactor

### Key Metrics Comparison
| Metric | After Refactor | Pre Refactor | Difference |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Final Total Agents | 81 | 59 | +22 |
| Final Total Resources | 14.0 | 16.0 | -2.0 |
| System Agents | 23 | 59 | -36 |
| Independent Agents | 32 | 0 | +32 |
| Control Agents | 26 | 0 | +26 |

### Performance Indicators
- **Agent Growth Trend**: After refactor showed higher growth rate
- **Resource Efficiency**: Improved resource utilization in after_refactor
- **Population Stability**: Both simulations maintained stable populations
- **Behavioral Diversity**: Significant increase in agent type diversity
