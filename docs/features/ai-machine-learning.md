# AI & Machine Learning

## Overview

AgentFarm integrates advanced AI and machine learning capabilities throughout the platform, enabling intelligent agents that learn from experience, automated discovery of patterns in simulation data, and evolution of sophisticated behaviors over generations. These features represent a convergence of agent-based modeling with modern machine learning, creating a powerful framework for studying adaptive systems and emergent intelligence.

The machine learning capabilities aren't superficial additions - they're fundamental components that enable new research questions. You can investigate how individual learning affects population dynamics, study the evolution of learning strategies, explore cooperation in populations of self-interested learners, and understand how intelligent agents collectively shape their environment and each other.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mathematical framework for agents to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error. AgentFarm implements several RL algorithms integrated directly into the agent architecture, making it straightforward to create learning agents that adapt their strategies based on rewards and penalties they experience.

Q-learning represents one of the fundamental RL algorithms. Agents maintain Q-tables that estimate expected future reward for each state-action pair. Through experience, these Q-values converge toward accurate estimates, allowing agents to identify and prefer high-value actions. The tabular Q-learning implementation works well for discrete state spaces where the number of possible states and actions is manageable.

```python
from farm.learning import DQNAgent, ReplayBuffer

# Create learning agent
agent = DQNAgent(
    state_size=observation_space.shape[0],
    action_size=len(action_space),
    learning_rate=0.001,
    gamma=0.99,
    epsilon=1.0,
    epsilon_decay=0.995
)

# Training loop
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        
        if len(agent.memory) > batch_size:
            agent.replay(batch_size)
        
        state = next_state
```

Deep Q-Learning (DQN) extends Q-learning to high-dimensional state spaces using neural networks to approximate Q-values. This is crucial for agents with rich perceptual inputs that can't be represented in lookup tables. The DQN implementation includes experience replay to stabilize learning and target networks to reduce the moving target problem. These innovations from the deep RL literature enable agents to learn effective policies in complex environments.

Policy gradient methods represent an alternative approach where agents directly learn a policy mapping from states to actions rather than learning value functions. These methods handle continuous action spaces more naturally and can learn stochastic policies. Actor-critic methods combine benefits of both approaches by maintaining both a policy (actor) and value function (critic), forming the basis of many state-of-the-art RL algorithms.

## Custom Reward Functions

The reward function defines what agents are trying to achieve, making it arguably the most important component of any RL system. AgentFarm provides extensive flexibility for defining custom rewards that capture your research objectives.

```python
class CustomRewardFunction:
    def __init__(self, weights):
        self.weights = weights
    
    def calculate_reward(self, agent, action, result):
        reward = 0
        
        # Health preservation
        reward += self.weights['health'] * (result.health_delta / 100)
        
        # Resource collection
        reward += self.weights['resources'] * result.resources_gained
        
        # Social cooperation
        reward += self.weights['social'] * result.cooperation_score
        
        # Survival bonus
        if agent.is_alive:
            reward += self.weights['survival']
        
        return reward
```

Multi-objective rewards allow agents to balance competing goals like survival, reproduction, resource acquisition, and social standing. Components can be weighted to reflect different priorities, and the weights themselves can be parameters you vary to study how different optimization objectives affect behavior. Reward shaping provides intermediate rewards that scaffold learning, helping agents learn more quickly than with sparse rewards alone.

## Experience Replay and Memory

Experience replay is crucial for stabilizing and improving reinforcement learning. AgentFarm implements replay buffers that store agent experiences (state, action, reward, next state tuples) and allow the learning algorithm to sample from this buffer during training. This breaks temporal correlation between consecutive experiences and makes more efficient use of data.

Prioritized experience replay extends basic replay by preferentially sampling experiences where the agent can learn most. Experiences with high prediction error receive higher sampling priority, focusing learning where it's most beneficial. The implementation includes importance sampling corrections to ensure learning remains unbiased despite non-uniform sampling.

Beyond learning, agents can maintain various memory architectures - episodic memories of past events, semantic knowledge about the environment, or working memory for planning. The richness of agent memory significantly affects their capabilities and the behaviors they can learn.

## Automated Pattern Detection

Machine learning also powers automated analysis of simulation data. Pattern detection algorithms automatically identify interesting structures in behavioral data, spatial distributions, temporal dynamics, and interaction networks. This automated discovery complements hypothesis-driven analysis by revealing unexpected patterns.

```python
from farm.analysis import PatternDetector

detector = PatternDetector()

# Analyze agent behaviors
behavioral_patterns = detector.find_behavioral_patterns(
    agent_actions,
    min_support=0.1,
    min_confidence=0.8
)

# Analyze temporal patterns
temporal_patterns = detector.find_temporal_patterns(
    time_series_data,
    window_size=50,
    stride=10
)

# Analyze spatial patterns
spatial_patterns = detector.find_spatial_patterns(
    agent_positions,
    clustering_method='dbscan'
)
```

Behavioral pattern mining discovers common sequences and motifs in agent action histories using sequence mining algorithms adapted from data mining and bioinformatics. These patterns provide insights into behavioral strategies and reveal structure in complex behavior. Temporal pattern detection identifies recurring patterns like cyclical dynamics, trend changes, and phase transitions using change point detection and time series clustering.

## Insight Generation

Beyond pattern detection, AgentFarm includes insight generation that automatically produces natural language descriptions of interesting findings. These systems analyze results, identify significant effects and relationships, assess statistical significance, and generate plain-language summaries that help you understand what happened and why.

```python
from farm.analysis import InsightGenerator

generator = InsightGenerator()

insights = generator.analyze_simulation(simulation_data)

for insight in insights:
    print(f"Type: {insight.type}")
    print(f"Description: {insight.description}")
    print(f"Significance: {insight.significance_score}")
```

The insight generation system identifies surprising results where outcomes differ from expectations, flags potential problems, highlights parameter sensitivities, and suggests follow-up analyses. This automated analysis helps extract maximum value from simulation experiments.

## Behavioral Prediction

Machine learning models trained on simulation data can predict future agent behaviors and system states. These predictive models serve multiple purposes - validating that simulations behave sensibly, enabling model-based planning, and supporting what-if analysis.

```python
from farm.learning import BehaviorPredictor

# Train predictor on historical data
predictor = BehaviorPredictor(
    model_type='lstm',
    sequence_length=10,
    features=['health', 'resources', 'position', 'neighbors']
)

predictor.train(historical_agent_data, epochs=50)

# Predict future behaviors
future_actions = predictor.predict(current_state, horizon=20)
```

Behavior prediction models learn to forecast actions based on current state and history. Sequence models like LSTMs are well-suited since they capture temporal dependencies. Outcome prediction models forecast simulation endpoints based on initial conditions and parameters, learning which factors most strongly influence outcomes. These models can guide experimental design by identifying promising parameter regions.

## Evolutionary Algorithms

AgentFarm provides comprehensive support for evolutionary algorithms where agent traits and behaviors evolve over generations through reproduction, inheritance, and selection. This enables studying adaptation, optimization, and the emergence of sophisticated behaviors through evolutionary processes.

```python
from farm.evolution import GeneticAlgorithm

# Define genome structure
genome_structure = {
    'movement_speed': (0.1, 5.0),
    'perception_radius': (5, 50),
    'aggression': (0.0, 1.0),
    'cooperation': (0.0, 1.0)
}

# Create genetic algorithm
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
    genome_structure=genome_structure,
    population_size=100,
    mutation_rate=0.01,
    crossover_rate=0.7,
    selection_method='tournament'
)

# Evolution loop
for generation in range(num_generations):
    fitness_scores = evaluate_population(ga.population)
    parents = ga.select_parents(fitness_scores)
    offspring = ga.crossover_and_mutate(parents)
    ga.population = offspring
```

Genetic algorithms evolve agent genomes encoding behavioral parameters, physical characteristics, or neural network architectures. The evolutionary process operates through parent selection based on fitness, crossover recombining genetic material, mutation introducing variation, and replacement determining which individuals survive. Genetic programming extends evolution to the space of programs or decision trees, allowing behaviors themselves to evolve.

Co-evolution occurs when multiple species or types evolve simultaneously, with each providing selection pressure on the others. AgentFarm supports co-evolutionary dynamics including predator-prey evolution, host-parasite interactions, and competitive evolution. These systems often produce complex arms races and dynamic equilibria.

## Genome Embeddings

For simulations involving evolution over many generations, analyzing genetic diversity and structure becomes important. AgentFarm includes machine learning tools for analyzing genomes through dimensional reduction and embedding techniques.

```python
from farm.evolution import GenomeEmbedding

# Create embedding model
embedder = GenomeEmbedding(embedding_dim=32)

# Train on genome sequences
embedder.train(genome_sequences)

# Analyze genome similarities
similar_genomes = embedder.find_similar(target_genome, k=10)

# Visualize genome space
embedder.visualize_genome_space(method='tsne')
```

Autoencoder architectures learn compressed representations capturing essential features while discarding noise. These embeddings enable measuring genetic similarity, identifying clusters of similar genotypes, and visualizing genetic variation structure. The embedding space often reveals structure not apparent in the original high-dimensional genome space.

## Neural Network Integration

AgentFarm integrates deeply with PyTorch, enabling agents to use neural networks for decision-making, perception processing, and learning. This opens up the full toolkit of deep learning to agent-based modelers.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class AgentBrain(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )
    
    def forward(self, observations):
        return self.network(observations)
```

Custom neural architectures can serve as agent "brains" processing observations and producing action selections. These can range from simple feedforward networks to complex architectures with attention mechanisms and hierarchical structure. Networks can be hand-designed based on domain knowledge or discovered through neural architecture search.

## Performance Optimization

Machine learning can be computationally intensive, so AgentFarm includes optimizations to keep learning-enabled simulations practical. GPU acceleration allows neural network training and inference to leverage specialized hardware when available. Batch processing of agent updates allows multiple agents to be processed simultaneously, improving both CPU and GPU utilization.

Model parallelism and data parallelism techniques enable scaling to very large models and populations. These techniques from the ML systems literature help AgentFarm scale to demanding learning scenarios.
