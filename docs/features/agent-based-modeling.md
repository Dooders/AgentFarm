# Agent-Based Modeling & Analysis

## Overview

AgentFarm provides a powerful agent-based modeling (ABM) framework for simulating complex systems where individual agents interact with each other and their environment. This feature enables researchers and developers to explore emergent behaviors, system dynamics, and complex adaptive systems.

## Key Capabilities

### Complex Simulations
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Run simulations with hundreds or thousands of interacting agents
- **Adaptive Behaviors**: Agents can learn, adapt, and evolve based on their experiences
- **Diverse Agent Types**: Support for heterogeneous agent populations with different behaviors and properties
- **Environmental Interactions**: Agents respond to and modify their environment

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Self-Organization**: Observe how complex patterns emerge from simple agent rules
- **Collective Behaviors**: Study group dynamics, swarming, flocking, and coordination
- **System Dynamics**: Analyze feedback loops, cascading effects, and non-linear interactions
- **Pattern Formation**: Identify spatial and temporal patterns that emerge over time

### Interaction Tracking
- **Agent-to-Agent Interactions**: Record and analyze direct interactions between agents
- **Environmental Influences**: Track how agents are affected by environmental conditions
- **Interaction Networks**: Build social networks and relationship graphs from agent interactions
- **Historical Analysis**: Examine how interaction patterns change over time

### Temporal Analysis
- **Trend Detection**: Identify long-term trends in agent populations and behaviors
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discover recurring patterns in agent actions and system states
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyze metrics and indicators over the course of simulations
- **Event Detection**: Identify significant events and phase transitions in the system

## Use Cases

### Research Applications
- **Ecology and Biology**: Model predator-prey dynamics, ecosystem evolution, and population genetics
- **Social Sciences**: Study social networks, opinion dynamics, and cultural evolution
- **Economics**: Simulate market behaviors, resource allocation, and economic systems
- **Urban Planning**: Model traffic flows, urban development, and infrastructure usage

### Educational Applications
- **Demonstration**: Visualize complex systems concepts and theoretical models
- **Exploration**: Allow students to experiment with parameter variations
- **Validation**: Test hypotheses about complex system behaviors

## Getting Started

### Basic Simulation Setup

```python
from farm.core.simulation import Simulation
from farm.config import SimulationConfig

# Configure simulation parameters
config = SimulationConfig(
    num_agents=100,
    num_steps=1000,
    environment_size=(100, 100)
)

# Create and run simulation
simulation = Simulation(config)
simulation.run()
```

### Analyzing Results

```python
from farm.data.services import SimulationDataService

# Load simulation results
service = SimulationDataService(simulation_id="sim_001")

# Analyze agent behaviors
agent_stats = service.get_agent_statistics()
interaction_network = service.get_interaction_network()

# Study emergent patterns
temporal_patterns = service.analyze_temporal_patterns()
spatial_clusters = service.analyze_spatial_clustering()
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Agent Behaviors
Define specialized agent types with custom decision-making logic:

```python
from farm.agents import Agent

class CustomAgent(Agent):
    def decide_action(self, observations):
        # Implement custom decision logic
        return self.select_optimal_action(observations)
    
    def learn_from_experience(self, reward):
        # Implement learning mechanisms
        self.update_policy(reward)
```

### Environmental Dynamics
Create dynamic environments that evolve over time:

```python
from farm.environment import Environment

class DynamicEnvironment(Environment):
    def update(self, step):
        # Update environmental conditions
        self.regenerate_resources()
        self.apply_seasonal_effects()
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Scalability**: Efficiently handle thousands of agents using spatial indexing
- **Optimization**: Leverage batch processing for improved performance
- **Memory Management**: Use database persistence for large-scale simulations
- **Parallel Processing**: Take advantage of multi-core systems for computation
