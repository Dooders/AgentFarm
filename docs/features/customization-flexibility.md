# Customization & Flexibility

## Overview

AgentFarm is fundamentally designed with flexibility and extensibility at its core, recognizing that every research question is unique and requires the ability to tailor simulations to specific needs. The platform provides comprehensive tools and patterns for customizing virtually every aspect of your simulations, from the highest-level configuration parameters down to the finest details of individual agent decision-making. This design philosophy ensures that researchers are not constrained by rigid frameworks but instead have the freedom to implement their specific models and scenarios while still benefiting from the platform's robust infrastructure.

The customization system in AgentFarm follows modern software engineering principles, particularly the Open-Closed Principle which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can extend the platform's capabilities through inheritance, composition, and plugin mechanisms without having to modify the core codebase. This approach provides stability and maintainability while offering maximum flexibility for researchers to implement their unique requirements.

## Comprehensive Parameter Configuration

At the foundation of AgentFarm's customization system is a powerful parameter configuration framework that allows you to define and manage all simulation parameters in a structured, maintainable way. Simulation parameters control fundamental aspects like population size, simulation duration, timestep size, random seeds for reproducibility, output verbosity, and numerous other settings that govern how simulations execute. These parameters can be adjusted to scale simulations from small exploratory runs to large-scale production experiments.

Environmental parameters define the world in which agents exist and operate. You can specify the dimensions and topology of the environment, whether it's a bounded rectangle, a toroidal world with wraparound edges, or a more complex graph structure. Resource distribution patterns can be configured as uniform, clustered, gradient-based, or according to custom spatial functions. Regeneration rates, carrying capacities, and other environmental dynamics are all parameterizable to create the environmental context appropriate for your research questions.

Agent parameters control the initial conditions and inherent capabilities of the agent population. You can specify starting health levels, initial resource endowments, sensory capabilities like perception radius and observation channels, physical attributes like movement speed and size, metabolic rates that determine resource consumption, and reproductive parameters that govern population dynamics. The flexibility to set these parameters independently for different agent types enables the creation of heterogeneous populations with diverse characteristics.

Behavioral parameters fine-tune how agents make decisions and learn from experience. Learning rates control how quickly agents update their knowledge or strategies, discount factors determine how agents value immediate versus future rewards, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs govern whether agents prefer familiar strategies or try new behaviors, action selection temperatures control the randomness in decision-making, and various thresholds determine when agents trigger different behaviors. These behavioral parameters are crucial for modeling adaptive agents that learn and evolve over the course of simulations.

## Flexible Rule Definition

Beyond parameters, AgentFarm allows you to define custom rules that govern how agents interact, how environments evolve, and how various processes unfold. Interaction rules specify what happens when agents encounter each other, defining outcomes for different types of interactions like cooperation, competition, communication, mating, and aggression. These rules can be simple deterministic mappings or complex probabilistic functions that depend on agent states, environmental context, and interaction history.

Environmental rules determine how the environment changes over time independent of agent actions. Resource regeneration can follow logistic growth models, decay exponentially, or regenerate according to custom functions. Environmental gradients can shift over time, representing seasonal changes or longer-term environmental trends. Disturbances can periodically impact portions of the environment, creating variability and challenging agents to adapt to changing conditions. These environmental dynamics add realism and complexity to simulations, preventing them from reaching static equilibria.

Physics rules govern movement, collision detection, and spatial constraints within the simulation world. You can implement momentum-based movement where agents have inertia, collision avoidance behaviors where agents steer to avoid obstacles and each other, boundary conditions that determine what happens when agents reach world edges, and energy costs associated with different types of movement. These physics rules create a more realistic spatial dimension to simulations and can significantly affect agent behavior and population dynamics.

Evolution rules control how agent characteristics change across generations through reproduction and inheritance. Mutation rates determine how frequently offspring differ from their parents, selection pressures influence which agents reproduce successfully, inheritance patterns specify whether traits are inherited additively, dominantly, or through more complex genetic mechanisms, and recombination determines how genes from two parents combine in offspring. These evolutionary rules enable the study of adaptive evolution and the emergence of optimized strategies over generational timescales.

## Versatile Configuration System

AgentFarm supports multiple approaches to configuration management, recognizing that different use cases and preferences require different tools. For many users, YAML configuration files provide an intuitive, human-readable way to specify simulation parameters. YAML's hierarchical structure naturally maps to the nested organization of simulation settings, and the plain-text format makes configurations easy to read, edit, version control, and share with collaborators. Configuration files can include comments to document parameter choices and can be validated against schemas to catch errors before simulations run.

For scenarios requiring dynamic configuration, programmatic configuration through Python code offers maximum flexibility. You can construct SimulationConfig objects directly in code, compute parameter values based on mathematical relationships, generate parameter configurations algorithmically for parameter sweeps, or even determine configurations at runtime based on previous results. This programmatic approach is essential for complex experiments where configurations cannot be fully specified in advance.

The configuration system also supports inheritance and composition, allowing you to define base configurations and then create variations by overriding specific parameters. This pattern promotes reusability and helps maintain consistency across related experiments. You might define a baseline scenario configuration and then create treatment variants that modify only the parameters being manipulated in your experiment, ensuring that all other settings remain constant across conditions.

Configuration validation is built into the system to catch errors early before investing time in running simulations. The validator checks for required parameters, ensures that parameter values fall within valid ranges, verifies that combinations of parameters are sensible, and warns about settings that might cause problems. This validation step saves time and frustration by identifying configuration issues before simulations launch.

## Custom Agent Implementations

The true power of AgentFarm's flexibility becomes apparent when implementing custom agent types tailored to specific research questions. The base Agent class provides a foundation that handles common functionality like state management, perception, and action execution, while leaving the decision-making logic open for customization. By subclassing Agent and implementing the decide_action method, you can create agents with any cognitive architecture or decision strategy you can imagine.

Custom agent implementations can range from extremely simple reactive agents that follow if-then rules, to sophisticated cognitive agents that build internal models of their environment and reason about optimal strategies. Reactive agents might simply move toward the nearest resource when hungry or flee from nearby threats. More complex agents might maintain beliefs about resource locations, plan multi-step action sequences to achieve goals, predict the behavior of other agents, and learn from experience to improve their strategies over time.

Memory systems can be customized to give agents different capacities for storing and using past information. Some agents might be purely reactive with no memory of past events, while others maintain detailed episodic memories of past experiences, semantic knowledge about the environment and other agents, or procedural memories encoded as learned policies. The memory architecture significantly affects agent behavior and learning capabilities, and AgentFarm provides the flexibility to implement whatever memory system best suits your model.

Perception systems determine what information agents have access to when making decisions. You can customize perception to implement limited perception ranges where agents only observe nearby entities, directional perception where agents have fields of view, noisy perception where observations are corrupted by random error, or perfect global knowledge for theoretical models that abstract away perceptual limitations. The perception system plays a crucial role in creating information asymmetries and uncertainty that agents must cope with.

## Behavioral Composition

Rather than implementing monolithic agent classes that try to do everything, AgentFarm encourages behavioral composition where complex agent behavior emerges from combining simpler behavioral modules. This compositional approach follows the principle of favoring composition over inheritance and makes it easier to create agents with multifaceted capabilities by mixing and matching behavior components.

Behavioral modules can be developed and tested independently and then combined in different configurations to create agents with different behavioral repertoires. For example, you might develop separate modules for foraging, social interaction, learning, and predator avoidance. Different agent types could then mix these modules in different proportions or with different parameterizations, creating behavioral diversity without duplicating code.

The behavioral composition approach also facilitates debugging and understanding agent behavior because you can isolate and test individual behavioral modules. If agents are behaving unexpectedly, you can examine specific behavioral components to identify the source of surprising behavior. This modularity also makes code more maintainable and reusable across different projects and research questions.

## Comprehensive Experiment Design

Beyond configuring individual simulation runs, AgentFarm provides extensive support for designing and executing complete experiments. The Experiment class serves as a framework for organizing parameter sweeps, running multiple replications, collecting results systematically, and performing comparative analyses. This structured approach to experimentation helps ensure that research is rigorous, reproducible, and well-documented.

Parameter sweeps are a fundamental experimental pattern where you vary one or more parameters across a range of values to understand their effects on simulation outcomes. AgentFarm supports both grid-based parameter sweeps that exhaustively cover a parameter space and adaptive sampling approaches that intelligently focus on interesting regions of the parameter space. The platform handles the logistics of generating parameter combinations, dispatching simulation runs, and organizing results for analysis.

Experimental designs can specify replication strategies to account for stochasticity in simulation outcomes. Multiple replications with different random seeds help distinguish systematic effects from random variation and provide estimates of uncertainty around measured outcomes. AgentFarm can automatically run the specified number of replications for each parameter configuration and compute summary statistics across replications.

## Scenario Definition and Management

Scenarios represent coherent, reusable simulation setups that combine environment configuration, agent population initialization, interaction rules, and other elements into a complete package. Defining scenarios as first-class objects promotes reusability and helps establish standard benchmarks that can be shared across research groups. A well-defined scenario completely specifies a simulation setup so that anyone can reproduce your results by running the same scenario.

Scenario definitions typically include environment initialization that places resources, creates terrain features, and sets initial environmental conditions. Agent initialization places agents with appropriate starting states and characteristics. Interaction rules specify how agents interact with each other and the environment. Measurement protocols define what data should be collected and how. By packaging all these elements together, scenarios provide a high-level abstraction for working with simulations.

The scenario system supports scenario composition where complex scenarios can be built from simpler components. You might define a base environment configuration and then add different agent populations to create scenario variants. This compositional approach reduces redundancy and makes it easier to create systematic comparisons where scenarios differ in well-defined ways.

## Extension Points and Plugin Architecture

For advanced customization needs, AgentFarm provides well-defined extension points where custom functionality can be integrated into the simulation pipeline. The action system is extensible, allowing you to define new action types beyond the built-in repertoire. Perception systems can be extended to implement custom observation channels that provide agents with novel types of information. Memory systems can be replaced entirely with alternative implementations that better suit specific modeling needs.

The plugin architecture allows functionality to be packaged as reusable modules that can be easily shared and integrated. Plugins can hook into various stages of the simulation lifecycle, including initialization, per-step updates, agent decision-making, and finalization. This architecture makes it possible to add cross-cutting concerns like custom logging, specialized analysis, or visualization without modifying core simulation code.

Analysis tools can be extended through custom analyzers that compute domain-specific metrics or apply specialized analytical techniques. These custom analyzers integrate seamlessly with the existing data infrastructure and can be composed with built-in analyzers to create comprehensive analysis pipelines. The extensibility of the analysis system means that AgentFarm can grow to accommodate new analytical needs as they arise.

## Configuration Management and Validation

Effective configuration management is essential for maintaining reproducibility and organization in computational research. AgentFarm provides tools for validating configurations before simulations run, catching errors early before wasting computational resources. Validation checks ensure that required parameters are present, parameter values are within acceptable ranges, parameter combinations are logically consistent, and configuration files conform to expected schemas.

Configuration templates provide starting points for common scenarios, encoding best practices and sensible defaults. Rather than starting from scratch, researchers can load an appropriate template and customize it for their specific needs. Templates reduce the learning curve for new users and help ensure that simulations are properly configured. The template system supports both built-in templates provided with AgentFarm and user-defined templates that can be shared within research groups.

Version control integration is facilitated by the plain-text nature of configuration files. Configurations can be committed to git repositories alongside code, making it easy to track how experimental designs evolve over time, document what parameters were used for specific analyses, and roll back to previous configurations if needed. This integration with standard development tools brings software engineering best practices to computational research.

## Best Practices for Customization

When customizing AgentFarm for your research, several best practices help ensure that your implementations are maintainable, efficient, and scientifically sound. Parameter organization is important—group related parameters together logically, use meaningful names that clearly indicate what each parameter controls, provide documentation explaining the purpose and valid ranges of parameters, and set sensible defaults that work well for typical use cases.

Modularity in implementation keeps components loosely coupled and focused on specific responsibilities. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle where each class or module has one clear purpose. Use dependency injection rather than hard-coding dependencies. Design interfaces that hide implementation details and focus on what components do rather than how they do it. This modular design makes code easier to understand, test, and modify.

Testing custom components is essential for ensuring correctness. Write unit tests that verify individual components work as expected in isolation. Create integration tests that verify components work together properly. Use property-based testing to check that implementations satisfy expected mathematical or logical properties. Validate against known analytical results or reference implementations when possible. Thorough testing catches bugs early and provides confidence that your implementation correctly reflects your intended model.

Performance profiling should be done early and often when customizing AgentFarm, especially for components that will be called frequently like agent decision-making or perception. Use Python's profiling tools to identify bottlenecks, optimize hot paths that consume most execution time, consider whether computations can be vectorized using numpy, and look for opportunities to cache results that don't change frequently. Performance optimization should be guided by measurement rather than intuition about what might be slow.
