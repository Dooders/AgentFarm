# Environment Module Redesign - Quick Summary

## The Problem

Your current environment is tightly coupled to a 2D grid structure, making it difficult to:
- Use different environment types (static catapult, robotic arm, continuous physics)
- Swap environments easily
- Test with mock environments

## The Solution

**Create a physics abstraction layer using the Strategy pattern**

```
Environment (orchestrator)
    ↓ delegates to
IPhysicsEngine (interface)
    ↓ implementations
Grid2DPhysics | StaticPhysics | ContinuousPhysics | CustomPhysics
```

## Key Benefits

1. ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing code works unchanged
2. ✅ **Simple Swapping** - Change one parameter to switch physics
3. ✅ **Clean Separation** - Physics logic isolated from RL logic
4. ✅ **Easy Testing** - Mock physics for unit tests
5. ✅ **Extensible** - Add custom physics without modifying core

## Quick Example

### Old Way (Still Works!)
```python
env = Environment(width=100, height=100, config=config)
```

### New Way - Grid2D
```python
from farm.core.physics import Grid2DPhysics

physics = Grid2DPhysics(width=100, height=100)
env = Environment(physics_engine=physics, config=config)
```

### New Way - Static (Catapult)
```python
from farm.core.physics import StaticPhysics

physics = StaticPhysics(
    valid_positions=[(angle, power) for angle in range(90) for power in range(100)],
    state_dim=2,
    observation_space_config={'shape': (3,)}
)
env = Environment(physics_engine=physics, config=config)
```

### New Way - Continuous
```python
from farm.core.physics import ContinuousPhysics

physics = ContinuousPhysics(
    state_dim=2,
    bounds=(np.array([0, 0]), np.array([100, 100]))
)
env = Environment(physics_engine=physics, config=config)
```

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Create `farm/core/physics/` module
- [ ] Define `IPhysicsEngine` protocol
- [ ] Implement `Grid2DPhysics` (wraps existing code)
- [ ] Add backward compatibility layer

### Phase 2: Refactor (Week 2)
- [ ] Update `Environment` to use physics engine
- [ ] Update services to delegate to physics
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Create migration examples

### Phase 3: New Physics (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement `StaticPhysics`
- [ ] Implement `ContinuousPhysics`
- [ ] Create catapult example
- [ ] Write documentation

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 4)
- [ ] Add physics factory
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] User guide and tutorials

## Decision Points

### ✅ What We Recommend

1. **Use Protocol, not ABC**: More flexible, better type checking
2. **Backward Compatible**: Keep old API working
3. **Incremental Migration**: No big bang refactor
4. **Composition**: Delegate to physics, don't inherit

### ❌ What to Avoid

1. Don't make it overly abstract
2. Don't break existing code
3. Don't mix physics with RL logic
4. Don't optimize prematurely

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this summary and the [full report](environment_module_design_report.md)
2. **Decide** on implementation timeline
3. **Create** Phase 1 foundation (minimal risk)
4. **Test** with backward compatibility
5. **Iterate** on new physics engines
