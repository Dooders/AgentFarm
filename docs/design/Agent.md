## Overview

AgentFarm agents are autonomous entities designed for multi-agent simulations. They follow the **Observation → Perception → Cognition → Action** loop described in the [Agent Loop Design](agent_loop.md), providing a structured approach to modeling intelligent behavior in complex environments.

The agent system is built around the `BaseAgent` class, which serves as the foundation for all agent types in the simulation. Agents are designed to be modular, extensible, and capable of learning through various decision-making algorithms.

## Architecture

### Core Components

The agent architecture consists of several key components:

1. **BaseAgent Class**: The fundamental agent implementation
2. **DecisionModule**: Pluggable decision-making algorithms
3. **Perception System**: Multi-channel observation capabilities
4. **Memory Systems**: Redis-backed persistent memory
5. **Genome System**: Genetic representation and evolution
6. **Service Integration**: Modular service architecture

### Agent Types

AgentFarm supports five primary agent types, all inheriting from `BaseAgent`:

- **SystemAgent**: Cooperative agents that prioritize collective goals with high resource sharing (0.3) and low aggression (0.05)
- **IndependentAgent**: Self-interested agents that prioritize individual survival with low resource sharing (0.05) and high aggression (0.25)
- **ControlAgent**: Balanced baseline agents with moderate sharing (0.15) and aggression (0.15) used for experimental comparison
- **RandomAgent**: Agents that make decisions through random action selection (future implementation)
- **LogicAgent**: Agents that use logical decision-making without machine learning (future implementation)

#### Future Agent Types

## Design Principles

The agent design follows several key principles:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `BaseAgent`: Core agent lifecycle and state management
- `DecisionModule`: Action selection and learning
- `AgentObservation`: Perception and observation management
- `AgentMemory`: Experience storage and retrieval

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
- New decision algorithms can be added without changing existing code
- New observation channels can be registered dynamically
- New services can be integrated through interfaces

### 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules depend on abstractions:
- Services are accessed through interfaces
- Decision modules use abstract configurations
- Memory systems use abstract storage backends

### 4. Composition Over Inheritance
Functionality is achieved through composition:
- Services are injected rather than inherited
- Decision modules are composed into agents
- Channel handlers are composed into observation systems

## Future Enhancements

6. **RandomAgent Implementation**: Agents that use random action selection for baseline comparisons and exploration studies
7. **LogicAgent Implementation**: Agents that use rule-based or logical decision-making without machine learning components

### Research Directions

2. **Collective Intelligence**: Multi-agent coordination and cooperation
3. **Adaptive Algorithms**: Self-modifying decision algorithms
4. **Cognitive Architectures**: More sophisticated cognitive models
5. **Ethical AI**: Incorporating ethical considerations into agent behavior

## Summary

AgentFarm agents represent a rigorous approach to multi-agent simulation, combining modular architecture, advanced learning capabilities, and scalable design. While they offer significant advantages in terms of flexibility and research capabilities, they also present challenges in terms of complexity and resource requirements.

The design successfully balances research needs with practical implementation concerns, providing a solid foundation for studying emergent behaviors, collective intelligence, and adaptive systems. The modular architecture ensures that the system can evolve and improve over time while maintaining backward compatibility and research reproducibility.

The agent system is particularly well-suited for:
- Research into multi-agent systems and emergent behaviors
- Studies of collective intelligence and cooperation
- Evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms
- Reinforcement learning in complex environments
- Large-scale population simulations

However, it may be less suitable for:
- Simple, lightweight simulations
- Real-time applications with strict latency requirements
- Environments requiring complex 3D spatial reasoning
- Applications with limited computational resources
