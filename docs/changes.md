# Changes to the Database Layer

## Overview

The database layer has been refactored to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability. The following modern architecture patterns have been implemented:

1. Repository Pattern
2. Unit of Work Pattern
3. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
4. Service Layer
5. Query Objects

## Repository Pattern

The repository pattern abstracts the data access logic, providing a clean interface to interact with the underlying database. This pattern centralizes data access logic, making it easier to modify or replace the data source.

### Changes

- Created a `BaseRepository` class with common CRUD operations.
- Implemented specific repositories for each domain entity, such as `AgentRepository`.

## Unit of Work Pattern

The Unit of Work pattern ensures that all changes to the database occur within a single transaction, providing atomicity and consistency. This pattern simplifies transaction management and ensures data integrity.

### Changes

- Implemented a `UnitOfWork` class to manage database transactions.
- Centralized transaction management across multiple repositories.

## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

DTOs decouple the data representation used in different layers of an application, separating internal database structures from external API contracts or service data. This enhances encapsulation and security by hiding database internals.

### Changes

- Created DTOs for all domain entities, such as `AgentDTO`.
- Added mapping functions to convert between database entities and DTOs.

## Service Layer

The service layer encapsulates business logic, separating it from data access and user interface layers. This promotes separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing of business logic.

### Changes

- Implemented service classes for business logic, such as `AgentService`.
- Moved logic from retrievers into the service layer.
- Used DTOs for data transfer between layers.

## Query Objects

Query objects encapsulate complex query logic into reusable, composable classes. This improves the readability and maintainability of query logic.

### Changes

- Created query builder classes for complex queries, such as `AgentQuery`.
- Made queries composable and reusable.

## Advanced Transaction Management

Advanced transaction management ensures data integrity, consistency, and performance during complex database operations. This includes error handling, rollback mechanisms, and retry logic.

### Changes

- Implemented advanced transaction management in `database/database.py` and `database/data_logging.py`.
- Added error handling and rollback mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

## Benefits

- Better separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Cleaner transaction management
- Type safety through DTOs
- More maintainable and reusable queries
- Reduced code duplication

## Implementation Steps

1. Created base classes and interfaces.
2. Implemented repositories one domain entity at a time.
3. Added Unit of Work pattern.
4. Created DTOs and mapping functions.
5. Implemented services.
6. Migrated existing code to new architecture.
7. Added tests for new components.
8. Updated documentation.
