# **Expanding the Memory Agent’s Decision-Making Process**

To make the **Memory Agent** more effective, we can explore three progressively smarter decision-making approaches:

1. **Direct Memory Lookup** (Basic)
   - Uses past experiences directly without modification.

2. **Weighted Decision-Making** (Intermediate)
   - Weighs multiple past experiences to determine the best action.

3. **Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning** (Advanced)
   - Combines hierarchical memory with reinforcement learning.

---

## **1️⃣ Direct Memory Lookup (Basic Decision-Making)**
This is the simplest approach:  
- **Retrieve the most similar past experience.**  
- **Repeat the same action** that was taken in the past.  

**Limitation:** If the environment has changed, blindly copying an old action may not work well.

### **Implementation**
```python
def make_decision_basic(self, state):
    """Retrieves a past experience and reuses the action."""
    retrieved_memory = self.retrieve_memory(state)

    if retrieved_memory is None:
        return np.random.choice(self.action_space)  # Random action if no memory found

    past_action = retrieved_memory[len(state)]  # Extract action from memory
    return past_action
```

---

## **2️⃣ Weighted Decision-Making (Intermediate)**
This approach improves on **direct memory lookup** by:
- **Retrieving multiple similar past experiences.**
- **Assigning weights based on similarity.**
- **Choosing the best action based on frequency or expected reward.**

### **Implementation**
```python
from collections import Counter

def make_decision_weighted(self, state, top_k=3):
    """Retrieves multiple past experiences and weighs their actions."""
    retrieved_memories = [self.retrieve_memory(state) for _ in range(top_k)]
    actions = [mem[len(state)] for mem in retrieved_memories if mem is not None]

    if not actions:
        return np.random.choice(self.action_space)

    # Count occurrences of each action
    action_counts = Counter(actions)

    # Select the most common action among top_k memories
    best_action = max(action_counts, key=action_counts.get)
    return best_action
```

### **Enhancement: Weighted Softmax Choice**
Instead of selecting the most frequent action, we can use **a softmax-weighted action selection** to give more weight to higher-similarity memories:

```python
import numpy as np

def make_decision_softmax(self, state, top_k=3, temperature=0.5):
    """Retrieves multiple past experiences and selects action using weighted probabilities."""
    retrieved_memories = [(self.retrieve_memory(state), self.retrieve_similarity(state, mem)) for _ in range(top_k)]
    
    actions, similarities = [], []
    for mem, sim in retrieved_memories:
        if mem is not None:
            actions.append(mem[len(state)])
            similarities.append(sim)

    if not actions:
        return np.random.choice(self.action_space)

    # Apply softmax weighting
    weights = np.exp(np.array(similarities) / temperature)
    weights /= np.sum(weights)

    # Sample an action based on weighted probabilities
    best_action = np.random.choice(actions, p=weights)
    return best_action
```

**Why use softmax?**  
- Gives **higher weight to more relevant memories.**  
- Avoids deterministic behavior and allows adaptation.

---

## **3️⃣ Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning (Advanced)**
This method combines **memory retrieval** with a **learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or policy gradients).**

### **How It Works**
- Retrieve past experiences to initialize action selection.
- Use **reinforcement learning (RL)** to **update and refine** the decision over time.
- Store new experiences in memory to improve future decisions.

### **Integration with Q-Learning**
Instead of blindly copying actions, the **agent uses memory to initialize Q-values** and improve learning.

```python
import random

def make_decision_rl(self, state, epsilon=0.1):
    """Uses memory as a Q-learning lookup table, but also explores new actions."""
    retrieved_memory = self.retrieve_memory(state)

    if retrieved_memory is None or random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
        return np.random.choice(self.action_space)  # Explore new actions

    # Extract Q-values (expected rewards) from memory
    past_q_values = retrieved_memory[len(state) + 1:]  # Assume Q-values are stored after action

    # Choose the action with the highest past Q-value
    best_action = np.argmax(past_q_values)
    return best_action
```

### **Enhancement: Memory-Based Q-Value Updates**
We can also use retrieved experiences to **update Q-values in reinforcement learning**, speeding up convergence.

```python
def update_q_values_with_memory(self, state, action, reward, next_state, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99):
    """Uses memory to update Q-values, integrating retrieved past experiences."""
    retrieved_memory = self.retrieve_memory(state)

    if retrieved_memory is not None:
        past_q_values = retrieved_memory[len(state) + 1:]
        target_q = reward + gamma * max(past_q_values)
    else:
        target_q = reward

    # Q-learning update rule
    self.q_table[state][action] = (1 - alpha) * self.q_table[state][action] + alpha * target_q
```

### **Advantages of Memory-Augmented RL**
✅ Uses **past experiences** to initialize learning, reducing the number of required interactions.  
✅ Avoids **catastrophic forgetting** by storing compressed versions of past experiences.  
✅ Allows **faster convergence** in reinforcement learning tasks.

## **Comparison of Decision-Making Approaches**

| Approach | How It Works | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Direct Memory Lookup** | Retrieve the most similar past experience and reuse its action. | Fast, simple, works well if environment is stable. | Fails if environment changes, ignores uncertainty. |
| **Weighted Decision-Making** | Retrieve multiple past experiences and weigh their actions. | More robust, considers multiple past cases. | Still relies on past experiences without adaptation. |
| **Softmax-Weighted Decision** | Use a probability distribution over retrieved experiences. | Reduces bias, adapts dynamically. | More computation-heavy. |
| **Memory-Augmented RL** | Use retrieved memories to initialize Q-learning updates. | Fast learning, avoids forgetting. | Requires tuning hyperparameters (alpha, gamma). |

---

## **Choosing the Best Approach**
- If the environment **rarely changes**, **direct lookup** is sufficient.
- If the agent **needs flexibility**, **weighted decision-making** is better.
- If the environment **is complex and dynamic**, **reinforcement learning with memory** is the best option.
