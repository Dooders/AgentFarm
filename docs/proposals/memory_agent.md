# **Memory Agent and Hierarchical Memory Compression in Agent-Based Systems**  

## **1. Introduction**  
Memory plays a crucial role in decision-making for intelligent agents. Traditional agent memory models either store all past experiences (resulting in inefficiency) or rely on short-term memory buffers (leading to loss of long-term patterns). This research proposes a **hierarchical memory model** where recent memories exist in high-dimensional space and are gradually compressed into lower-dimensional representations over time.  

We aim to develop and experiment with a **Memory Agent** that leverages this hierarchical memory system and evaluate its impact on **retrieval accuracy, memory efficiency, and agent decision-making**.

## **2. Research Objectives**  

1. **Develop a Hierarchical Memory System**  
   - Implement a memory structure with **Short-Term Memory (STM), Intermediate Memory (IM), and Long-Term Memory (LTM)**.  
   - Design compression mechanisms for reducing memory resolution over time.  

2. **Evaluate Memory Compression Techniques**  
   - Compare **autoencoder-based compression** vs. **dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVD)**.  
   - Measure how much information is retained at each stage.  

3. **Test Memory Retrieval Performance**  
   - Investigate how well older, compressed memories can be retrieved and reconstructed.  
   - Measure the **trade-off between compression efficiency and retrieval accuracy**.  

4. **Apply the Memory Agent in a Simulated Environment**  
   - Integrate the memory system into an **agent-based simulation** (e.g., reinforcement learning or game environments).  
   - Analyze the effect of hierarchical memory on **decision-making and long-term planning**.

## **3. Methodology**  

### **3.1 Memory Architecture Design**  
The Memory Agent will have a **three-tier hierarchical memory system**:  

| Memory Layer | Description | Compression Method |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **STM (Short-Term Memory)** | Stores recent experiences in full detail. Fast access. | No compression. Direct storage. |
| **IM (Intermediate Memory)** | Stores moderately compressed memories. Retains key details. | Autoencoders or PCA reduce dimensionality. |
| **LTM (Long-Term Memory)** | Stores highly compressed, abstract representations of past experiences. | Further compression via deep autoencoders. |

Memory transitions occur when a layer reaches capacity, moving older memories to the next level while reducing resolution.

### **3.2 Experimental Setup**  

#### **3.2.1 Synthetic Memory Experiment**
1. Generate synthetic memory vectors representing agent experiences.  
2. Store, transition, and retrieve memories using STM → IM → LTM hierarchy.  
3. Evaluate compression efficiency, retrieval accuracy, and computational cost.  

#### **3.2.2 Reinforcement Learning Experiment**
1. Integrate the Memory Agent into AgentFarm. 
2. Compare agent performance with **hierarchical memory vs. traditional replay buffers**.  
3. Analyze **learning efficiency and long-term planning improvements**.

### **3.3 Evaluation Metrics**  
To assess memory performance, we will track the following metrics:  

| Metric | Description | Expected Outcome |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Reconstruction Loss** | Measures the information loss due to compression. | Lower is better. |
| **Retrieval Accuracy** | Measures how often the correct memory is retrieved. | Higher is better. |
| **Compression Ratio** | Tracks how much memory size is reduced over time. | Higher compression with minimal information loss. |
| **Query Time** | Measures retrieval speed across different memory layers. | Lower retrieval time is preferred. |

## **4. Expected Outcomes**  
- A **functional hierarchical memory system** that balances **storage efficiency and retrieval fidelity**.  
- Empirical insights into **how compression impacts memory retention** in agents.  
- Potential applications in **agent-based simulations, reinforcement learning, and AI decision-making systems**.  

---

## **5. Future Work**  
- Explore **adaptive forgetting mechanisms** based on relevance.  
- Test **graph-based memory retrieval** instead of linear hierarchy.  
- Apply to **real-world AI tasks**, such as language models or autonomous systems.
