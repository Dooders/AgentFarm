# **Proposal: Biomimetic Health System for AgentFarm Agents**

## **1. Executive Summary**

This proposal outlines the implementation of an advanced biomimetic health system for AgentFarm agents. The system models biological health mechanisms more accurately than the current numerical health representation, introducing homeostasis, allostatic load, multidimensional health vectors, resource-dependent recovery, epigenetic adaptation, aging, and social health factors. This enhancement will enable more realistic agent behaviors, emergent survival strategies, and complex evolutionary dynamics.

## **2. Background & Motivation**

Currently, AgentFarm agents use a simplified health model:
- Single numerical value (`current_health`) from 0 to `starting_health`
- Health decreases from damage during combat
- No natural regeneration or deterioration systems
- No physiological subsystems or dependencies
- Limited impact on agent capabilities

While functional, this approach fails to capture the complexity of biological health systems that enable rich emergent behaviors in natural organisms. More sophisticated health mechanisms would allow for:

1. Realistic trade-offs between different survival strategies
2. Complex environmental adaptations
3. Intergenerational health dynamics
4. Emergent social behaviors around health maintenance
5. Better alignment with current biomimetic AI research
