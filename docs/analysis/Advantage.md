# Relative Advantage Analysis

1. **Resource Acquisition Advantage**
   - Measures which agent types are better at acquiring resources
   - Analyzes average resource levels across different simulation phases (early, mid, late)
   - Tracks advantage trajectories to see if advantages increase or decrease over time

2. **Reproduction Advantage**
   - Compares reproduction success rates between agent types
   - Analyzes reproduction efficiency (resources spent per successful reproduction)
   - Tracks first reproduction timing (which agent type reproduces earlier)
   - Measures reproductive output (total offspring produced)

3. **Survival Advantage**
   - Compares average lifespans between agent types
   - Analyzes survival rates (percentage of agents still alive)
   - Tracks mortality patterns across simulation phases

4. **Population Growth Advantage**
   - Measures population growth rates across simulation phases
   - Analyzes population stability (consistency of growth)
   - Tracks population recovery after setbacks

5. **Combat Advantage**
   - Compares combat success rates between agent types
   - Analyzes resource gain from combat
   - Tracks combat initiation patterns (which agent types initiate combat more often)

6. **Composite Advantage**
   - Combines multiple advantage dimensions into a comprehensive score
   - Weights different advantage types based on their correlation with dominance
   - Provides an overall measure of which agent type has the greatest advantage

7. **Advantage-Dominance Correlation**
   - Analyzes how different advantages correlate with eventual dominance
   - Identifies which advantages are most predictive of dominance outcomes
   - Determines threshold levels of advantage needed to achieve dominance

## Analysis Capabilities

1. **Cross-Simulation Analysis**
   - Analyzes advantage patterns across multiple simulations
   - Identifies consistent advantage patterns that emerge across different initial conditions
   - Determines the stability of advantages across simulations

2. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Tracks how advantages evolve over time within simulations
   - Identifies critical phases where advantages are established
   - Analyzes advantage trajectories (increasing, decreasing, or stable)

3. **Advantage Pattern Analysis**
   - Identifies correlations between different types of advantages
   - Determines which advantages tend to co-occur
   - Analyzes how early advantages translate to later advantages

4. **Advantage-Dominance Relationship**
   - Analyzes how advantages correlate with eventual dominance
   - Identifies threshold levels of advantage needed for dominance
   - Determines which advantages are most predictive of dominance

5. **Advantage Recommendations**
   - Provides recommendations for improving agent performance based on advantage analysis
   - Identifies critical advantages that should be prioritized
   - Suggests timing strategies for when to focus on different advantages

## Visualization Capabilities

1. **Advantage Correlation Matrix** - Shows correlations between different advantage types and dominance
2. **Advantage Category Importance** - Visualizes which advantage categories matter most for each agent type
3. **Top Dominance Predictors** - Shows which specific advantages best predict dominance for each agent type
4. **Advantage Thresholds** - Visualizes the threshold levels of advantage needed to achieve dominance
5. **Advantage Timing** - Shows when different advantages matter most during simulation phases
6. **Composite Advantage Breakdown** - Visualizes the components of the composite advantage score
7. **Advantage Trajectories** - Shows how advantages evolve over time within simulations

This relative advantage analysis framework provides a comprehensive set of tools for understanding which agent types have advantages in different dimensions, how these advantages evolve over time, and how they contribute to eventual dominance in your simulations.
