## System Overview

### Mission & Requirements

The perception system provides:

- **Real-time observation generation** for hundreds to thousands of agents
- **Multi-channel environmental awareness** with temporal persistence
- **Neural network compatibility** with existing RL frameworks
- **Scalable memory usage** that grows linearly with agent count
- **Efficient spatial queries** for proximity-based perception

### Core Innovation: Hybrid Architecture

The system combines:

- **Sparse internal storage** for memory efficiency
- **Lazy dense construction** for computational performance, with optional prebuilding of high-frequency channels (`high_frequency_channels`) for fast O(1) copies during dense builds
- **Channel-specific optimization** strategies (including prebuilt high-frequency channels and vectorized sparse population)
- **Spatial indexing** for efficient proximity queries

---

## Key Principles

### Local, Agent-Centric Perception

**Local Perspective Fields**: Each agent receives a small window (configurable) centered on their position, creating **subjective, limited experiences** rather than global knowledge.

**Orientation Alignment**: The agent's facing direction is aligned to "up" in the perception grid based on each agent's `orientation` (degrees, 0=north). World layers and entities are rotated accordingly for agent-centric perception. Default `orientation=0` preserves legacy behavior.

**Limited Field of View**: Agents can only "see" within a certain radius, with areas beyond this masked as unknown, simulating **partial observability**.

### Multi-Channel Observations

The system uses **13 default channels** (indices 0-12) that can be extended:

**Entity Channels** (Sparse storage, INSTANT behavior):

- `SELF_HP` (Index 0) - Agent's current health at center position
- `ALLIES_HP` (Index 1) - Visible allies' health at their positions
- `ENEMIES_HP` (Index 2) - Visible enemies' health at their positions

**Environmental Channels** (Dense storage, INSTANT behavior):

- `RESOURCES` (Index 3) - Resource distribution with bilinear interpolation
- `OBSTACLES` (Index 4) - Obstacle/passability map
- `TERRAIN_COST` (Index 5) - Movement cost terrain
- `VISIBILITY` (Index 6) - Field-of-view visibility mask

**Temporal Channels** (Sparse with decay, DYNAMIC behavior):

- `KNOWN_EMPTY` (Index 7) - Previously observed empty cells (decays over time)
- `DAMAGE_HEAT` (Index 8) - Recent damage events (decays over time)
- `TRAILS` (Index 9) - Agent movement trails (decays over time)
- `ALLY_SIGNAL` (Index 10) - Communication signals (decays over time)

**Navigation Channels**:

- `GOAL` (Index 11) - Target waypoint positions (INSTANT behavior)
- `LANDMARKS` (Index 12) - Permanent reference points (PERSISTENT behavior)

### Spatial Reasoning & Efficiency

**KD-Tree Spatial Indexing**: Uses scipy.spatial.cKDTree for O(log n) proximity queries with smart change detection to minimize rebuilds.

**Key Features**:

- **Multi-level optimization**: Dirty flag check (O(1)) → Count check (O(1)) → Hash verification (O(n))
- **Named index system**: Configurable indices for different entity types (agents, resources, etc.)
- **Automatic filtering**: Built-in support for filtering (e.g., only alive agents)
- **Position validation**: Relaxed bounds checking with 1% margin for edge cases

**Query Types**:

- `get_nearby(position, radius, index_names)` - Radius-based entity queries across multiple indices
- `get_nearest(position, index_names)` - Single nearest entity lookup per index
- Coordinate transformation from world → local observation space

### Channel Behaviors

**INSTANT**: Completely overwritten each simulation step with fresh data. Used for current state information that doesn't need to persist between ticks.

**DYNAMIC**: Persist across ticks and decay over time using configurable gamma factors. Values gradually fade away, simulating the natural decay of transient information.

**PERSISTENT**: Remain unchanged until explicitly cleared. Used for long-term memory and permanent environment features that should accumulate over time.

gflops = (total_cells × operations_per_cell × steps) / 1e9 / total_time
```

**Per-Agent Update Time:**
```
update_time_ms = (total_time / (steps × agents)) × 1000
```

               (agent.position[1] - agent_obj.position[1])**2)**0.5
