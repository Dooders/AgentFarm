# Issue #19 Completion Report: Comprehensive Toolbar System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive toolbar for the configuration GUI, covering file operations, comparison controls, application controls, status indicators, and keyboard shortcuts.

## Key Changes
- Added `src/components/Layout/Toolbar.tsx` and integrated into `DualPanelLayout`.
- File operations: Open, Save, Save As, Export JSON/YAML (Electron-native with browser fallbacks).
- Comparison controls: Show/Hide, Load Compare, Clear Compare, Apply All.
- App controls: Grayscale toggle (persisted), Reset to defaults.
- Status indicators: Unsaved changes, validation error/warning counts, file path, last save/load times, connection status.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+O, Ctrl/Cmd+S, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S, Ctrl/Cmd+Y, Ctrl/Cmd+G.
- Store updates: `currentFilePath`, `lastSaveTime`, `lastLoadTime` tracked in `useConfigStore`.
- Utility: Extracted YAML serialization to `src/utils/yaml.ts`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All sections functional and responsive.
- Shortcuts registered and working.
- Status indicators provide meaningful feedback.
- Toolbar integrates with existing features without performance regressions.

## Tests
- Added `src/components/__tests__/Toolbar.test.tsx` to verify control presence, grayscale toggle, and Save enablement after edits.

## Follow-ups
- Optional: Replace browser file pickers with Electron native dialogs via IPC for Open/Save As.
- Optional: Add preset management actions per Phase 4 roadmap.
